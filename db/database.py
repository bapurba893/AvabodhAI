db/database.py
--------------
SQLAlchemy engines + session factories.

TWO engines, deliberately, not one:

  _admin_engine — connects using DB_USER/DB_PASSWORD (the Postgres
  superuser in this docker-compose setup). Used ONLY inside init_db(),
  ONLY for one-time schema bootstrap: creating tables, the full-text-
  search trigger, the restricted app role, and the Row-Level Security
  policies. Never used to serve a real request.

  engine — connects using APP_DB_USER/APP_DB_PASSWORD (a restricted,
  non-superuser role created by init_db()). This is what every real
  request in this app actually queries through.

Why the split exists: Postgres Row-Level Security CANNOT restrict a
superuser's queries — that's a fixed Postgres rule, no policy setting
changes it. If the app queried using the superuser for everything, the
RLS policies created below would provide zero real protection for the
app's own traffic. This split is what makes RLS meaningful at all.

    tenant_id/org_unit_id set on the current session (via set_config()
    in get_db_session_fastapi/get_db_session_context below).

    FORCE (not just ENABLE) is required — without it, RLS is silently
    skipped for the table's OWNER, and in a simple setup like this the
    app role often ends up owning the tables it creates. FORCE closes
    that gap. It does NOT and cannot restrict an actual Postgres
    superuser — nothing can, by Postgres design — which is the whole
    reason the app connects as the restricted role above, not as
    DB_USER.

    same way USING restricts SELECT. Every write path in this codebase
    already sets tenant_id/org_unit_id explicitly and correctly at the
    Python level (see pipeline/storage.py, embedder.py, chat_storage.py)
    — RLS's job here is to be the backstop for ad-hoc READS (a teammate
    in pgAdmin, a future report, a bug in some other service), not to
    re-validate writes that are already independently guaranteed correct.
    Making writes fail-closed too would mean any request whose session
    variables aren't set for any reason (a bug, a forgotten header on a
    brand-new endpoint) fails LOUD on the write path, which is arguably
    safer — but it also means this table becomes unwritable the moment
    that wiring has any bug at all, anywhere. Read-side enforcement gets
    most of the real-world protection (this is what stops the "someone
    ran an unscoped SELECT in pgAdmin" scenario) at a much smaller blast
    radius. Revisit this trade-off if write-path correctness is ever in
